# 💡 Graphics Programming 1 – Raytracer  

Hey there, fellow DAE student, curious visitor, or graphics enthusiast 👋  
Welcome to my **Graphics Programming 1 – Raytracer** repository — part of the **third semester (2023)** at **DAE**.

---

## 🗄️ About this repository

This repo contains all **lab exercises** and **weekly projects** created during the **Graphics Programming 1** course.  
It’s shared mainly for **archival and educational purposes** — documenting my learning progress in **low-level rendering** and **graphics programming**.

> ⚠️ Keep in mind: these projects were made while learning the fundamentals of computer graphics.  
> Expect imperfect reflections, noisy shadows, and a few math headaches — it’s all part of the process.  
> Consider this repo a **snapshot of early rendering experiments**.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This repository represents my **first steps into 3D graphics programming** — writing my own raytracer from scratch, debugging math errors, and finally watching pixels turn into realistic images.  
It’s messy, rewarding, and a huge learning milestone toward understanding rendering pipelines.

If you’re diving into graphics yourself: **stick with it**, **visualize the math**, and **enjoy the moment you see your first reflection render correctly** ✨
